 * This is my attempt at recreating the old
 * MS-DOS game 'Gorllas'. It was a simple 
 * 2D side view game, where the only goal
 * was to blow up your opponent using angle
 * and trajectory values. Characters for 
 * both players were the same model of a gorilla.
 * The object thrown is shown as a yellow
 * spinning banana that followed the angle
 * and speed entered by the player. Each 
 * will take turns throwing and whoever hits 
 * first wins the round.
